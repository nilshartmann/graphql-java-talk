# GraphQL Example Application "Beer Advisor"

This repository contains a very simple GraphQL example application, using the following technology stack:

- [graphql-java](https://www.graphql-java.com/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Apollo GraphQL for React](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo)

# Installing and starting

Prerequisites:

- Clone this repository locally
- Port 9000 must be available for the backend
- Port 9020 must be available for the user "microservice" (REST API)
- Port 9080 must be available for the frontend webserver
- You need to have installed Java/JDK 11 for the backend and `yarn` for the frontend build and dependency management (`npm` might also work)

**Step 1: Build and start the backend**

1. Open a terminal inside the `backend` folder
2. Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the Spring Boot-based application.
3. The application now should listen on port 9000.

**Step 2: Build and start the user microservice**

1. Open a terminal inside the `userservice` folder
2. Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start the Spring Boot-based REST userservice.
3. The service now should listen on port 9020.

**Step 2: run either the frontend using stable Apollo APIs _OR_ the one using the unstable Apollo Hook API**

Step 2a: Install, build and start the frontend (_stable_ Apollo API)

This version uses the stable Apollo React Client:

1. Open a new terminal inside the `frontend` folder
2. Install the npm packages: `yarn install`
3. Start the webpack web server: `yarn start`
4. The webserver now should listen on http://localhost:9080

Step 2b: Install, build and start the hooks-based frontend

This version uses the stable React Hooks API (16.8) and the **unstable** [Apollo Hooks](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/tree/release-3.0.0/packages/hooks) API.

1. Open a new terminal inside the `frontend-hooks` folder
2. Install the npm packages: `yarn install`
3. Start the webpack web server: `yarn start`
4. The webserver now should listen on http://localhost:9080

(You can find examples of Apollo Hooks in `BeerPage.tsx`, `ShopPage.tsx` and `UpdateBeer.tsx`)

Now everything runs. You can open in your browser:

- http://localhost:9080 for the demo application frontend
- http://localhost:9000/graphiql.html for the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) API Explorer

Enjoy! üíê

# More Examples

Inside [this repository](https://github.com/nilshartmann/graphql-examples) you can find more variations of the Beer Advisor application, developed with different tech stacks.

You can also find my Spring PetClinic fork that works with GraphQL on a Spring-based Server: [spring-petclinic-graphql](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-graphql) (note: this uses an old Apollo API).

# Article on GraphQL

I've written a (german) article about GraphQL, React and TypeScript that uses this example application in the iX newspaper. You can read the article [here online](https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2019/6/1909808311106276205) (Note: behind paywall).
